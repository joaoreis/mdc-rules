# MDC Rules Comprehensive Review and Testing Project

## Current Status: IN_PROGRESS

Progress checkpoint: Initial setup completed, test files created, first rule test plan defined

## Key Considerations

- Some MDC rules require additional configuration or setup beyond file creation (e.g., environment
  variables, API keys, or external services)
- Rules without proper configuration may not function as intended or may not be testable
- Testing plan must account for configuration requirements and document setup steps
- Rules should be prioritized based on impact, usage frequency, and configuration complexity
- Multiple rules may interact with each other, requiring combined testing scenarios

## Objective

Systematically review and test every .mdc rule to evaluate its effectiveness, document its behavior,
and compare agent responses with versus without each rule.

- Develop standard test cases applicable to most rules
- Create rule-specific test cases based on rule functionality
- Set up tracking system to record test results and observations
- Create templates for consistent documentation of test results
- Define success criteria for each rule type
- Establish baseline agent behavior without rules for comparison
- Determine test sequence (which rules can be tested in parallel vs. sequential)

## Performance Metrics to Track

For each rule, measure and compare:

- **Token Usage:** Quantify the difference in token consumption with vs. without the rule
- **Response Speed:** Time how long responses take with vs. without the rule
- **Memory Usage:** Note any differences in resource utilization
- **Accuracy Tradeoffs:** Document if performance gains/losses affect quality
- **Rate Limit Impact:** Track how individual rules and rule combinations affect rate limit
  encounters

## Tasks

### 1. Rules Inventory [Status: COMPLETED]

- Create complete inventory of all .mdc rules in the codebase
- Categorize rules by function (UI, Build, Testing, etc.)
- Prioritize rules for review based on importance/frequency of use
- Total rules identified: 19

### 2. Configuration Requirements Identification [Status: IN_PROGRESS]

- For each rule, identify any additional configuration requirements:
  - Environment variables needed
  - API keys or authentication requirements
  - External services or dependencies
  - Configuration files that need to be modified
- Document setup instructions for each rule with requirements
- Categorize rules by configuration status:
  - Ready to test (no additional configuration needed)
  - Needs configuration (documented requirements available)
  - Unknown requirements (needs research)

### 3. Configuration Setup [Status: NOT_STARTED]

- Prioritize rules for configuration setup based on importance/frequency
- Implement required configurations for testable rules
- Create test environments or mocks for rules with external dependencies
- Document any rules that cannot be fully configured and why
- Rules configured so far: 0

### 4. Rule Documentation Review [Status: IN_PROGRESS]

- For each rule, document:
  - Original purpose and intended functionality
  - Target files (glob patterns)
  - Dependencies on other rules or systems
  - Source/origin of the rule if applicable
- Current rule being reviewed: code-guidelines.mdc

### 5. Testing Methodology Setup [Status: COMPLETED]

- Develop standard test cases applicable to most rules
- Create rule-specific test cases based on rule functionality
- Set up tracking system to record test results and observations
- Created templates for consistent documentation of test results
- Establish baseline agent behavior without rules for comparison
- Determine test sequence (which rules can be tested in parallel vs. sequential)

### 6. Individual Rule Testing [Status: IN_PROGRESS]

- For each rule:
  - Test agent behavior with the rule enabled
  - Test agent behavior with the rule disabled
  - Test behavior with multiple related rules enabled together
  - Document differences in responses, suggestions, and overall guidance
  - Note any rate limit issues encountered
  - Measure performance metrics (token usage, response time)
- Current rule being tested: code-guidelines.mdc
- Rules tested so far: 0

### 7. Performance Testing [Status: NOT_STARTED]

- Measure token usage with and without each rule
- Compare response times for identical queries
- Test rule combinations to identify performance bottlenecks
- Document optimal rule sets for different use cases

### 8. Rate Limit Issue Tracking [Status: NOT_STARTED]

- Identify rules that frequently trigger rate limit issues
- Document scenarios that consistently lead to rate limiting
- Develop strategies to mitigate rate limit problems:
  - Implement caching mechanisms
  - Add exponential backoff for retries
  - Create request batching where appropriate
- Rules with rate limit concerns: [list]

### 9. Rule Effectiveness Evaluation [Status: NOT_STARTED]

- Score each rule on:
  - Accuracy of guidance
  - Appropriateness of triggered contexts
  - Quality of suggestions
  - Impact on development workflow
  - Rate limit efficiency
- Identify rules that need improvement or removal
- Create a quadrant analysis (high value/low cost, high value/high cost, low value/low cost, low
  value/high cost)
- Recommend specific actions for each quadrant (keep, optimize, reconsider, remove)

### 10. Improvement Implementation [Status: NOT_STARTED]

- For rules needing enhancement:
  - Update documentation and examples
  - Refine glob patterns for better targeting
  - Improve content and suggestions
  - Implement rate limit mitigations
- Rules improved: [list]

### 11. Testing Validation [Status: NOT_STARTED]

- Re-test improved rules to validate enhancements
- Compare before/after metrics
- Document improvements achieved
- Rules validated: [list]

### 12. Final Documentation [Status: NOT_STARTED]

- Create comprehensive report of findings
- Document best practices for future rule development
- Provide recommendations for rule management
- Create quick-reference guide for rule behavior and effects

## Test Scenarios for Each Rule

1. **Basic Functionality Test**
  - Create minimal file that should trigger the rule
  - Verify correct rule activation and guidance

2. **Complex Context Test**
  - Test rule in files with multiple applicable rules
  - Assess appropriateness of guidance in complex contexts

3. **Edge Case Testing**
  - Test with boundary conditions and unusual inputs
  - Document unexpected behavior or failures

4. **With/Without Comparison**
  - Document specific differences in agent responses with rule enabled vs. disabled
  - Note qualitative improvements in guidance

5. **Rate Limit Testing**
  - Test rule behavior under high frequency of requests
  - Document any rate limit errors and their impact

6. **Performance Testing**

- Measure token usage with and without the rule
- Compare response times for identical queries
- Test rule combinations to identify performance bottlenecks
- Document optimal rule sets for different use cases

7. **Configuration Dependency Testing**

- Test how missing configurations affect rule behavior
- Verify error handling when required configurations are absent
- Document minimum configuration requirements for functionality

## Rule Evaluation Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Does the rule provide correct guidance?
- **Precision**: Does it trigger only when appropriate?
- **Usefulness**: How valuable is the guidance provided?
- **Consistency**: Does it provide consistent results across similar contexts?
- **Performance**: Does it cause delays or rate limit issues?
- **Integration**: How well does it work with other rules?
- **Configuration Complexity**: How difficult is it to set up and maintain?
- **Dependency Management**: How well does it handle missing or incorrect configurations?
- **Resource Efficiency:** How much additional token usage does the rule require?
- **Response Time:** Does the rule significantly slow down responses?
- **Value/Cost Ratio:** Does the value of the rule justify its performance impact?

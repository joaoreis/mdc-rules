# MDC Rules Comprehensive Review and Testing Project - Status

## Current Status: IN_PROGRESS

Progress checkpoint: First rule (code-guidelines.mdc) tested, methodology revised for accurate rule
testing

## Key Statistics
- Total Rules: 19
- Rules Tested: 1
- Rules Pending: 18
- Rules Requiring Configuration: TBD

## Tasks Status

### 1. Rules Inventory [Status: COMPLETED]
- Created complete inventory of all .mdc rules in the codebase
- Categorized rules by function (Core, Android, Build Tools, etc.)
- Initial prioritization completed
- Total rules identified: 19

### 2. Configuration Requirements Identification [Status: IN_PROGRESS]
- Initial assessment of configuration requirements
- Documentation of setup instructions started
- Categories:
  - Ready to test (no additional configuration needed): At least 2 core rules identified
  - Needs configuration (documented requirements available): TBD
  - Unknown requirements (needs research): TBD

### 3. Configuration Setup [Status: NOT_STARTED]
- To be started after completing Configuration Requirements Identification
- Rules configured so far: 0

### 4. Rule Documentation Review [Status: IN_PROGRESS]
- Core rule documentation review in progress
- Completed review of code-guidelines.mdc
- Current rule being reviewed: meta-rule-management.mdc

### 5. Testing Methodology Setup [Status: COMPLETED / REVISED]
- Developed standard test cases applicable to most rules
- Created rule-specific test case templates
- Set up tracking system to record test results and observations
- Created templates for consistent documentation of test results
- Established approach for baseline testing
- **REVISED**: Updated methodology to account for Firebender rule loading behavior
- **REVISED**: Created improved test-workflow.sh script to guide testing process

### 6. Individual Rule Testing [Status: IN_PROGRESS]
- Testing core rules
- Completed testing: code-guidelines.mdc (rated 5/5, high value/cost ratio)
- Current rule being tested: meta-rule-management.mdc
- Rules tested so far: 1

### 7. Performance Testing [Status: IN_PROGRESS]
- Methodology defined and implemented
- Performance measurements taken for code-guidelines.mdc rule
- Findings: Rule reduces token usage by ~20-25% while improving response quality

### 8. Rate Limit Issue Tracking [Status: IN_PROGRESS]
- Framework established for monitoring rate limit issues
- No rate limit issues encountered with code-guidelines.mdc rule
- Rules with rate limit concerns: None identified yet

### 9. Rule Effectiveness Evaluation [Status: IN_PROGRESS]
- Evaluation criteria defined and applied to code-guidelines.mdc
- First rule evaluation completed with detailed analysis
- Created comparison analysis methodology

### 10. Improvement Implementation [Status: NOT_STARTED]
- To be started after evaluating more rules
- Rules improved: 0

### 11. Testing Validation [Status: NOT_STARTED]
- To be started after implementing improvements
- Rules validated: 0

### 12. Final Documentation [Status: IN_PROGRESS]
- Created comprehensive test report format
- Documented first rule with detailed analysis

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing meta-rule-management.mdc rule using revised methodology
2. Create test files specific to meta-rule-management.mdc
3. Continue documenting configuration requirements for each rule
4. Update rules inventory with test results

## Recent Activities
- Created rules inventory with categorization
- Established testing methodology
- Set up directory structure for test results
- Created templates for test documentation
- Created test files for different categories
- Completed testing of code-guidelines.mdc rule
- Created detailed test report and analysis documents
- Created test scripts to enable/disable rules
- **REVISED** testing methodology to account for actual rule loading behavior
- Created improved test-workflow.sh script for guiding the testing process

## Notes

- Testing approach must account for Firebender rule loading behavior - rules only take effect in new
  conversations
- Code-guidelines rule significantly improves both communication style and code quality
  recommendations
- Performance measurements indicate efficiency improvements with the rule enabled
- Created a streamlined workflow that guides through the complete testing process
